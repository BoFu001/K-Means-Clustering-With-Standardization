## K-Means Clustering: With Standardization and Inverse Transform

This notebook is part of my personal study and practice in unsupervised machine learning, with a specific focus on K-Means clustering using standardized features. It demonstrates how to apply K-Means clustering **after standardizing** the features with `StandardScaler`. Additionally, it performs an **inverse transformation** of the cluster centers to visualize them in the original feature space. In this notebook, I will explore:


- Data loading and visualization
- Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Applying K-Means and visualizing the result
